# The dataset 

The dataset *wine-quality-white-and-red.csv* includes the result of physicochemical and sensory tests for the red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. It contains  

It includes the following 13 variables:  

* Qualitative
  + **type**:  Red or White variant. 
  + **quality**: based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10. (Response)
* Quantitative
  + **fixed.acidity**: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).  
  + **volatile.acidity**: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste.  
  + **citric.acid**: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.  
  + **residual.sugar**: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops.  
  + **chloride**: the amount of salt in the wine.  
  + **free.sulfur.dioxide**: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.  
  + **total.sulfur.dioxide**: amount of free and bound forms of S02.  
  + **density**: the density of wine is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.  
  + **pH**: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic).  
  + **sulphates**: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.  
  + **alcohol**: the percent alcohol content of the wine.

Dear students,

Once I have approved your data sets, it is possible to start working on the first step of the project. In this first step, you have to:

1. Perform a graphical analysis of the data set and try to obtain interesting conclusions from the analysis. Take into account the qualitative variables in your data set and check which are really informative to distinguish the groups formed by such variable. 

# Data Visulization 


2. Estimate the main character√≠stics of the quantitative variables (mean vector, covariance matrix, correlation matrix) with all the observations in the data set as well as in each of the groups with the most appropriate method. Give conclusions from the analysis.

# 
3. Try to find outliers as well as any other characteristic of interest.

4. Impute missing data, if any.

Note: Under strong skewness it would be helpful to take logarithms of the skewed variable.

The deadline to do so is December, 14th, 2021 at 10:45.

Best regards,

Pedro Galeano.
